# Candidate Experience Insights Repository

Welcome! I'm Elif Schaefer, an experienced professional currently navigating the challenging journey of job seeking. Throughout my career, I've faced various employment challengesâ€”whether due to mass layoffs, mutual agreements, or personal resignations. Each time, I've noticed a significant gap in public platforms where candidates can share their experiences.

While there's an abundance of advice on how candidates can prepare for interviews and present themselves as the "perfect" candidate, there seems to be less focus on the hiring managers, recruiters, and the hiring processes themselves. Are these processes perfect? What about the candidate experience?

This repository aims to explore what can be improved in hiring processes. By sharing these insights, I hope to foster a sense of belonging for long-term job seekers, career changers, and those who may feel isolated due to negative candidate experiences. The goal is to bring awareness to areas where the hiring system has room for improvement.

**Purpose**

This repository is a collection of insights and experiences related to the candidate journey, with the aim of:

- Providing a platform for sharing underrepresented candidate experiences.
- Highlighting areas of improvement in the hiring process.
- Offering support to those who might feel alone in their job search journey.
