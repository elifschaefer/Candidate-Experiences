# Candidate-Experiences

This repo is created to keep the collected insights about the candidate experiences for the purpose of creating a sense of belonging for the unemployed people, long term job seekers, career changers etc. Here you can find the insights which are rarely publicly shared.

This is not a result of a scientific research. The insights might be too subjective. But the intention was to keep a diverse pool of insights which might help you feel you're not alone feeling certain ways while dealing with the difficult circumstances as a job seeker.

You can reach out to me on LinkedIn if you want to share your ideas in this repository. I try to keep the anonymity of the contributions. That's why the repo is not open for PRs.
